Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Format
1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose: Why this SRS document is being written.
1.2. Scope: The high-level goals and what the software will and will not do.
1.3. Intended Audience: Who will read and use this document (e.g., developers, testers, project managers).
1.4. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations: Explains technical terms so everyone understands them the same way.

2. Overall Description
2.1. Product Perspective: How the system fits with other software or hardware.
2.2. Product Functions: A simple list of the main things the software will do.
2.3. User Classes and Characteristics: Who will use the software and what they need.
2.4. Operating Environment: Where the software will run (e.g., Windows, web browser, mobile).
2.5. Design and Implementation Constraints: Any limits on how the software must be built (e.g., must use a specific database).

3. System Features (Functional Requirements)
3.1. [Feature 1 Name, e.g., User Login]
Description: What this feature is for.
Priority: How important this feature is (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
Requirements: A detailed list of what the feature must do, often written as "The system shall...".
3.2. [Feature 2 Name, e.g., Search for Trains]
*(Same sub-headings as 3.1 for each feature)*

4. External Interface Requirements
4.1. User Interfaces: What the screens, pages, or menus will look like (can be a reference to mockups).
4.2. Hardware Interfaces: How the software will connect to any physical devices.
4.3. Software Interfaces: How the software will connect to other systems (e.g., payment gateway, database).

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1. Performance Requirements: How fast and responsive the system needs to be (e.g., "Page must load in under 2 seconds").
5.2. Security Requirements: How user data and the system will be protected.
5.3. Reliability: How often the system can fail (e.g., "Must be available 99.9% of the time").
